# My Portfolio
## What is this?
### This is a website I am creating to act as a portfolio. It will contain information about me and the projects I have worked on. It will also be a living portfolio that will get updated as I continue to gain more experience.

## Why am I doing this?
### I am creating this website/portfolio so that I have a collection of all I have done by the end of my college years. I am also doing this as a way to get better and creating a website from start to finish using angular 5 and ngx-bootstrap. 

## What are some basic design idea's?
### The starting plan to create this website is to use Angular and ngx-bootstrap to create an angular app that will contain all the things needed for a portfolio. It will also only be a static website, as in no backend is needed to run the website. For the different compenents I will have, first I plan on having a main routing component that will load between the different pages from in the file structure. Then I will create have a main component that basically holds everything inside of it, this will probably consist mostly of a header and footer for the website allowing me to have a controller component for inside the main body. With this design set out, my hope is to make the website able to self generate using the html pages I create so I only have to make the individual post's and everything else will automatically update.

## Can you use this project?
### The project will be open for anyone to use and reference to create anything but I will not be held responsible for any happenings that come from using my code. Stated shortly, use at your own risk, but you can use it however you want with out crediting me.
